# Rickys Coding-Quiz

## Description

I've created a coding quiz that will test the user with 5 multiple choice coding questions. They are timed with this quiz and for every question they get correct they will get 10 seconds added onto their time, but for every question wrong they will lose 5 seconds and if the timer hits zero they must restart. This quiz is intended to test the users knowledge in coding. 

## Usage

When using the coding quiz, you must first hit start in the intro screen which will then start the clock and start the quiz questions. You only have one chance to answer a question and depending if you get it right or wrong you will lose or gain time. Also the quiz will prompt you if you have gotten a question wrong or right when you choose an option. At the end of the quiz, you will be shown a results screen which will show your results and if you wish to log your name into the site you can do so by typing in your name and it will save your name and grade.

## Features

Some of the features of my application consist of, a start button that will start the quiz and timer at the same time, a results screen that will show the user what their score is at the end of the quiz. Also if the user runs out of time, they will be brought back to the results screen and have the option to restart or log their score. Also another feature I added was that the user is only allowed to choose one option and wont be able to made changes to that.
